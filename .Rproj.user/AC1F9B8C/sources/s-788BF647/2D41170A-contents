# Analysis #

We cannot conclude that the data is multivariate normal, since all but the Mardia Skewness test rejected the null hypothesis. Moreover only variables  V3 and V4 appear to be univariate normal. V3 and V4 were both labeled as univariate normal by the Shapiro-Wilik test and the Cramer Von Mises test, and both tests rejected the hypothesis of normality for all other vaiables.
